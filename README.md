  I'm a fourth-year student pursuing an Information Technology Engineering degree 🎓 at Can Tho University of Technology 🏛. I'm a passionate learner, always willing to learn and work across various technologies and fields 💡. I love exploring new technologies and continually improving myself to be better than yesterday ✨. My GitHub page contains several personal projects that I have completed based on the fundamental knowledge I have self-taught during my time at university. If you find them useful, you can download and refer to them for free 👨🏻‍💻.
